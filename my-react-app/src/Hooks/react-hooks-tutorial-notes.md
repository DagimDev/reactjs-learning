What are Hooks?
React Hooks are special functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components.
Before Hooks, only class components could handle state or lifecycle methods. Hooks made functional components powerful and reusable.

When do we use a Hook?
We use Hooks inside functional components when we need to:
    Manage state (useState)
    Perform side effects like fetching data or updating the DOM (useEffect)
    Reuse logic across components (useCustomHook)
    Hooks make components cleaner and more modular.
