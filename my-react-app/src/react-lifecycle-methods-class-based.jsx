//  React component’s lifecycle methods (class based)
    // ● What is a React component’s lifecycle? React component’s lifecycle is as the series of
    // events that happen from the birth of a React component to its death. In short, React
    // component lifecycle is the “lifetime” of a component.

//  What are the four stages a React component goes through in its lifecycle?
// ▪ Initialization: This is the stage where the component is constructed with the
    // given Props and initial state. This is done in the constructor of a class component.
// ▪ Mounting: This is the stage where the component is mounted on the DOM and
    // rendered for the first time on the webpage. Mounting is the stage of rendering the
    // JSX returned by the render method itself. This is basically the birth of a
    // component.
// ▪ Updating: Updating is the stage when the state of a component is updated, and
    // the application is repainted. This is basically the growth of a component.
// ▪ Unmounting: As the name suggests unmounting is the final step of the
    // component lifecycle where the component is removed from the page. This is
    // basically the death of a component.
