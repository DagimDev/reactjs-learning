What is React.js?
▪ Definition 1: React. js is a JavaScript library that is used for building
    part of a website/app that the user interacts with, also known as a
    user interface. This means that React is used for front-end
    development and runs in the browser. 
▪ Definition 2: React is a JavaScript library that aims to increase the
    performance of applications and simplify the development of visual
    interfaces. React.js is used for handling the view layer of the full
    MVC stack for web and mobile apps.


Why is React called the view in the view layer of MVC?
▪ MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework: MVC is an
    architectural/design pattern in software design that separates an
    application into three main logical components: Model, View, and
    Controller. In its simplest form, it can be as simple as three folders,
    each dedicated to store the Model, View, and Controller components
    of an application in an organized manner.
● Model component: This component stores all the data and
    the logic of our website/app
● View component: This component defines how the
    website/app should display the data to the user. In short, this
    component generates part of the website that the user views
    or interacts with.
● Controller component: This component, upon
    mouse/keyboard inputs from the user, orders the Model to
    update its data and then notifies the View component to
    display the updated data. In short, this is a component that
    serves in the middle between the Model and Controller
    components by receiving and sending data from the View
    component to the Model component and vice versa.
    
Why React is called the View in the MVC layer: React is usually
    considered as the View layer of MVC because it is used to build and
    render part of a website that the user interacts with. In short, React
    only focuses on the View component.
