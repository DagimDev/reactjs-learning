. How does ReactJS work?
    The “react" library and the “react-dom” package: There are two
    main React libraries we use to build the UI components of a web
    application:
▪ The “react” library: React is a JavaScript library that lets you
    develop a top user interface/UI for both web and mobile
    applications. It also manages/tracks changes
● Why import React from the “react” library? We import
    React because the JSX code we write in our React component
    must be converted into vanilla JavaScript. Even if it is Babel
    that does the conversion of your JSX into vanilla JavaScript,
    Babel needs to use the createElement method available under
    the React (React.createElement method).
● No need to import React from “react” for simple
    components: React has introduced a new JSX transform with
    the release of React 17, which automatically transforms JSX
    without using React.createElement. This allows us to not
    import React, however, you will need to import React if, in
    your component, you use Hooks and other exports that React
    provides
