        <!-- use React & vanilla JavaScript to build a simple JavaScript application
▪ 1. Create an HTML document
▪ 2. Include “react” library and “react-dom” package into your HTML
document
● Note: Both React and ReactDOM are available over a CDN
under the following link
● https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html
● Why include “react” library? We included this library
because it has a method called “createElement()” that is
needed to create elements. Syntax: createElement(type,
{props}, children)
o The “type” parameter: This represents the type of the
HTML element. Example: <h1>, <p>, etc.
o The “{props}” parameter: This represents a
JavaScript object containing the properties required to
construct the element. Example: {style: {size:10px}}
or {className: “firstPar”} or {Eventhandlers}, etc.
o The “children” parameter: This represents any
child/nested element we want to create -->
      </div>
      <div>
        <!-- Why include the react-dom” package: We included this
package in our HTML because "react-dom" has a
method/function called “render()” that will stick/render the
created React elements into the DOM to be displayed by the
browser.
Syntax: ReactDOM.render(element, containerElement)
o The “element” parameter: The element that needs to
be rendered in the DOM
o The “containerElement” parameter: Where to
render in the dom -->
