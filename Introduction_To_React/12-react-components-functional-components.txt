React components (functional components)

Component: A React component is one of the major building blocks of React. Every
    application you will develop in React will be made up of independent and reusable pieces
    code, called components

Difference between a component and a plain JavaScript file: A component
    has the same purpose as a JavaScript function has, except that a component
    returns a React element via a render function

Component name must start in uppercase: The name of a component should
    always start with a capital letter. This is done to differentiate a component tag
    from HTML tags in our JSX. For instance, if you name your component as
    “button” and render this component as <button/> in your App.js, instead of
    rendering your <button /> component, React ignores it and renders a vanilla
    <button> element instead. This is because the button component is not
    capitalized when referenced in ReactDOM.render() method

Keep one component in one file: There is a convention to keep only one
    component in one JavaScript file
