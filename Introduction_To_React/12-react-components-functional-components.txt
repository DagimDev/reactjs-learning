React components (functional components)

Component: A React component is one of the major building blocks of React. Every
    application you will develop in React will be made up of independent and reusable pieces
    code, called components

Difference between a component and a plain JavaScript file: A component
    has the same purpose as a JavaScript function has, except that a component
    returns a React element via a render function
