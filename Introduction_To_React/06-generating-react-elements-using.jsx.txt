Generating React elements using JSX: As we have seen above, we
    can create React elements using plain JavaScript. We can also create
    React elements using React (JSX).
▪ Why JSX preferred to create React elements?
    ● Creating React elements using vanilla JavaScript takes time.
    ● Creating React elements using vanilla JavaScript will not
        allow us to use the benefit of React’s virtual DOM. This
        means that every time there is a change to the DOM elements,
        the entire DOM object needs to re-render, which slows down
        the performance of our website. Therefore, using the React
        library and JSX to create React elements provide us a way to
        manage changes in the DOM without the need to re-render
        the entire DOM as the React library has its own efficient
        mechanism of handling it.
    ● JSX also allows React to show more useful error and warningmessages.
