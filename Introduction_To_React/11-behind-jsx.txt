Browser doesn’t understand JSX. What happens behind the scenes
    when we write JSX code? When we write code in JSX, it is converted
    “behind the scenes” into JavaScript during runtime. The “translation”
    from JSX into JavaScript and React is done through the use of Babel,
    which compiles your code into an older version of JavaScript (ES5) that
    all browsers support.
● Babel JavaScript compiler: Your browser does not understand JSX by
    default. Your browser only understands HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To
    make your browser understand what you write using modern additions
    like JSX, your JSX code must be translated into the vanilla JS, the
    language the browser understands. For JSX, we usually use Babel.
    Babel ultimately converts it to vanilla JS for the browser to understand
    it. Note: Babel is already included in the boilerplate generated by
    create-react-app, which you most likely used to create your React app,
    so you don’t need to configure anything to use JSX. Example: Let us
    see how our JSX in our React component is converted to vanilla JS by Babel
▪ Our functional React component is written in JSX: Below, we
    have our HTML written in JavaScript or simply in JSX. See below
    how JSX is allowing us to write the paragraph tag <p> in JavaScript.
            function Person( ) {
                return (
                    <p>Hello React!</p>
                );
            }
▪ Babel transforms our code, which is written with JSX elements,
    into React.createElement calls: Our JSX code will be transformed
    into the following vanilla JS code.
            function Person() {
                return React.createElement(
                    “p”,
                    null,
                    “Hello React”
                );
            }
