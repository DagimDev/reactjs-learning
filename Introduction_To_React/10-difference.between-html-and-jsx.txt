Difference between HTML and JSX: Even though JSX is very similar
to HTML, notice these differences.
▪ JavaScript's reserved keywords cannot be used in JSX: For
    instance, class property in HTML cannot be used in JSX and is thus
    replaced by “className” in JSX. Similarly, the “for” attribute in
    HTML is “HTMLFor” in JSX, since "for" is one of the most
    common JavaScript reserved keywords.
▪ In JSX, you must return a single parent element, or it won't
    compile: Nested JSX must return one element, which we’ll call a
    parent element that wraps all other levels of nested elements.
    However, in HTML, multiple elements can be returned.
▪ In JSX, it is possible to write JavaScript directly: The minute you
    wrap your code in curly braces {} in JSX, React will understand it to
    be JavaScript code. Whereas in HTML, you need a script tag or an
    external JavaScript file to implement JavaScript.
▪ All HTML attributes and event references in JSX must be in
    camelCase: In HTML, you do not have to use camelCase for
    attributes, IDs, and event references. In JSX, HTML attributes and
    event references must be in camel case, and that is why the “onclick”
    event becomes “onClick” in JSX.
▪ All Tags Self-close in JSX: In HTML almost all tags have an
    opening and a closing tag. In JSX, however, any element can be
    written as a self-closing tag, for example, <div/>, but it is not
    advised to do so. Your React app will not compile if you have a <br>
    because there's no forward slash before the right-angle bracket of the
    line break tag
● Expression/code inside curly braces { } in JSX: When you wrap an
    expression/code inside curly braces in JSX, you are saying that the
    expression is a JavaScript variable, or property, or any other valid
    JavaScript code. In short, we use curly braces in JSX to embed a
    JavaScript expression
▪ In React, curly braces are a special syntax to let the JSX
    parser/interpreter know that it needs to interpret the contents in
    between the braces as JavaScript instead of a string
