Generating React elements using vanilla JavaScript vs generating React elements using React(JSX)
Vanilla/plain JavaScript: It is simply JavaScript written without
libraries like React or jQuery.
● React element(s): React element is the smallest entity in react. React
    element is an object representation of a DOM element in memory. It’s
    important to note that a React element isn’t actually the thing you’ll see
    on your screen. Instead, it’s just an object representation of what you see
    on your screen. React elements can be created using vanilla JavaScript
    or React (JSX).
● Generating traditional DOM vs generating React DOM:
▪ Traditional DOM is generated from HTML code: Traditionally,
    the DOM is generated from an HTML code that is passed to the
    browser directly.
▪ React DOM is generated from JSX: To improve the efficiency of
    recreating DOM, React decided to generate the HTML using
    JavaScript (JSX) and manage it as JavaScript object instead. In other
    words, when you build your application using React, you create your
    HTML using JSX, a markup that allows us to write HTML in
    JavaScript by converting HTML tags into React elements. JSX is not
    a requirement for using React.
▪ JSX is not a requirement for using React: Each JSX element is
    just syntactic sugar for calling React.createElement(component,
    props, ...children). So, anything you can do with JSX can also be
    done with just plain JavaScript. Note: Using React without JSX is
    especially convenient when you do not want to set up compilation in
    your build environment. To help us understand this concept, let us
    start by building a simple page where we create the HTML using
    palin JavaScript.
