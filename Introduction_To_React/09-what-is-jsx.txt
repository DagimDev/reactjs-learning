What is JSX (JavaScript XML)?
● What is JSX? (JavaScript XML):
▪ JSX is an extension to the JavaScript language created as syntactic
    sugar for React.createElement(). It is a syntax created by React
    developers to create HTML using JavaScript. In short, JSX makes it
    easier to write HTML in React and finally place them in the DOM
    without using React.createElement().
▪ JSX follows HTML’s syntax and rules of XML.
