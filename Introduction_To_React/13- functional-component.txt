What is a functional Component? The simplest way to define a component is to write a
    JavaScript function. A functional component is simply a JavaScript function may or may
    not take a data as a parameter but returns a React element (JSX)
▪ React element: a React element is an object that virtually describes the DOM Nodes that a component
    represents
▪ Example of a functional component

     function JustPractice() {
         return <div> JustPractice </div>;
     }
▪ Example of a functional component (using arrow function)
     const JustPractice = () => {
        return <div>JustPractice</div>;
     };
