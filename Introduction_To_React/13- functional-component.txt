What is a functional Component? The simplest way to define a component is to write a
    JavaScript function. A functional component is simply a JavaScript function may or may
    not take a data as a parameter but returns a React element (JSX)
▪ React element: a React element is an object that virtually describes the DOM Nodes that a component
    represents
▪ Example of a functional component

     function JustPractice() {
         return <div> JustPractice </div>;
     }
▪ Example of a functional component (using arrow function)
     const JustPractice = () => {
        return <div>JustPractice</div>;
     };

Function based components: steps to create functional components
    ● Steps to create a functional component:
        o 1. We have seen in our last class how to create a React app using "create-react-app".
            Make sure to create a React app first
        o 2. Go to the “src” folder and create a new JavaScript file for your component
        o 3. Import all the necessary files/components and libraries (such as “react” library
            from “react”) to the component
            ● To work with jsx in JavaScript file we will have to import the React library.
                Syntax: import React from 'react';
            ● If we want to use a component our newly created component, we will import
                that component. Syntax: import Footer from "./Footer";
            ● Note: No need to mention the “.js” file extension when importing
                your Footer.js component because build workflow automatically
                considers the import as a “.js” or “.jsx” file type by default. If file is
                of different type, example a “.css” file, then we will need to mention
                the extension of the file importing it
        o 3. Create a functional component by simply creating a JavaScript function
            ● Type the “rfce” abbreviation/snippet without the quotation marks. This is
                basically a shortcut to create a functional component structure/boilerplate.
                The “rfce” shortcut will import the React library, create your functional
                component and export your component for other components to use it. Note:
                Make sure you have the “ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets”
                extension installed on your VSC to access the above shortcut from your
                component
        o 4. Export the component: To be able to use a component later, we need to first export
            it so we can import it and use it somewhere else
            ● Syntax to export: export default NameOfComponent
            o 5. Render your component in your App.js
            ● Syntax: < NameOfComponent />
    
    ● Sample functional component using the above steps:
        // JustPractice.js
        import React from 'react'
            function JustPractice() {
                return <div>JustPractice</div>;
            }

        export default JustPractice;
