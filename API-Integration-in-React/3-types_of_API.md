Types of API (Web API, Program API and Local API): We said that an API is a set of
definitions and protocols used to integrate data from one application into another.
    o First party API vs third party API: To choose between first and third party
        APIs, developers need to look at what the API will do for the organization’s
        customers. If an AAPI is going to be very specific for a client's need, then a first
        party API might be a better option. However, if the API’s purpose is general,
        developers should save money by using third party APIs.
