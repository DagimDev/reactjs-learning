Types of API (Web API, Program API and Local API): We said that an API is a set of
definitions and protocols used to integrate data from one application into another.
    o First party API vs third party API: To choose between first and third party
        APIs, developers need to look at what the API will do for the organization’s
        customers. If an AAPI is going to be very specific for a client's need, then a first
        party API might be a better option. However, if the API’s purpose is general,
        developers should save money by using third party APIs.
                
        ● First party API: A First Party API is an API that was made in-house by
            the internal developers and is not requested by any third parties.
            Developing first party APIs is needed when there is a need to monitor the
            entire API lifecycle or when unique client cases or when there is a
            security need. However, developing and implementing an API in-house
            is expensive, takes time/ resources and requires constant upkeep by the
            API developers whenever your code or project changes.
        ● Third party API: Third party APIs are APIs developed by a third party
            organization and not developed by in-house by the internal developers.
            A third-party API integration happens when a business uses a
            third-party's API to power its web service. For the most part, third party
            APIs are reliable in providing you with all the data you might need to run
            your business, without the hassle of developing it yourself. However,
            these APIs will have their own rules for use and might require extra
            effort to integrate them with your application. However, that is not a
            huge problem to overcome.
        o For instance, if your business uses/integrates Google's open
        weather API for your business’ website.
