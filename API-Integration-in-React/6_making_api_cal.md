Making API call: An API call is the process by which a client application makes a
    request for data from an external server/application and the receiving server delivers the
    requested data back to the client. Traditionally, performance limitations dictated APIs to
    make synchronous requests which meant that users taking actions within an application,
    for example pulling specific info from a database had to await a backend response before
    continuing onward.
▪ Almost all API calls are asynchronous: Almost modern applications are designed to
    scale quickly with user activity and more user activity means more requests. Due to that,
    most APIs these days make asynchronous requests. to We know that asynchronous APIs
    are great in instances where user activity is heavy. Asynchronous API requests excel at
    executing background tasks without getting in each other’s way.
