Introduction to API: what do we mean by API?
    ▪ API (Application Program Interface): In general terms, API is a software/framework
        that allows your application (for example, your www.apple.com website) to communicate
        and exchange data with other applications (for example, with YouTube).
    o Interface: Interface is the Keyword which in pure English means a point where
        two systems meet and interact. An API is a point where an application interacts
        with another application. In short, API is an interface with a set of
        functions/methods/code that developers use to access data from another
        application and integrate it into their application.
    ▪ API explained in simple example: Assume you are taken back to the year 1650 when
        telephone was not invented. Let us say you were in your house and your mom was in her
        house few blocks away from yours. Assume you wanted to ask your mom for her “doro
        wot” recipe, but you were too lazy to run down the road yourself. So, you sent your
        daughter with a message request for your mom. Your daughter ran down there and
        brought back the recipe back to you. In this example, your daughter is the API, she sends
        your recipe request to your mom and brings you back the response recipe from your mom
        while you and your mom stayed where you were.
