Introduction to API: what do we mean by API?
    ▪ API (Application Program Interface): In general terms, API is a software/framework
        that allows your application (for example, your www.apple.com website) to communicate
        and exchange data with other applications (for example, with YouTube).
    o Interface: Interface is the Keyword which in pure English means a point where
        two systems meet and interact. An API is a point where an application interacts
        with another application. In short, API is an interface with a set of
        functions/methods/code that developers use to access data from another
        application and integrate it into their application.
    ▪ API explained in simple example: Assume you are taken back to the year 1650 when
        telephone was not invented. Let us say you were in your house and your mom was in her
        house few blocks away from yours. Assume you wanted to ask your mom for her “doro
        wot” recipe, but you were too lazy to run down the road yourself. So, you sent your
        daughter with a message request for your mom. Your daughter ran down there and
        brought back the recipe back to you. In this example, your daughter is the API, she sends
        your recipe request to your mom and brings you back the response recipe from your mom
        while you and your mom stayed where you were.

    History of APIs: APIs have been around almost as long as computing. For instance,
        before the Internet, APIs existed, but in local networks form (covering limited area).
    o Modern APIs: However, the history of modern APIs (web-based APIs), began
        taking shape in early 2000s when Salesforce launched its web API followed by
        Amazon and eBay. These companies took advantage of the new medium, the
        internet, to make products and services available to customers via a single
        website and ensure that partners and third-party resellers could extend the reach
        of their websites. As internet (websites) continued to be the default medium of
        doing business, business companies that collect data from their customers started
        to be overwhelmed by their data to the extent that they became unable to
        read/share customer's data or even tell who their customer was or what they want.
        Because of that, companies started to hire third-party companies called Customer
        Relationship Management (CRM) platforms that store their data in the cloud.
    o Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platforms: In addition to storing
        a company’s data in the cloud, the CRM platforms use software to analyze a
        company’s data to improve the company’s customer service, to assist in customer
        retention and to ultimately to drive the company’s sales growth. Examples of
        renowned CRM companies/software are Salesforces, Zoho CRM and Bitrix24

    Problem APIs were created to solve: As companies increased their business online, they
        started to require their sales and human resource employees to make “data-driven”
        decisions. Because more and more of company data was being stored “in the cloud” by
        Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems like Salesforce, data that could
        easily be used by any employee of a company became very hard to access from these
        third-party CRM systems. We all know that sales and HR employees do not have a higher
        level of software literacy to query their company’s data from these third-party CRM
        platforms. Due to this, many companies were forced to pay for other web service like
        Tableau to fetch their own data from their CRM in order to use the data to make “data
        driven” decisions for their business. The fact that companies had to pay both for a CRM
        platform (to store their data) and to pay for other companies (to fetch their data from
        CRM platforms) made these companies to force their CRM platforms to simplify their
        complex way of transferring data. CONCLUSION: Therefore, web APIs were created to
        simplify the way organizations fetch their own data from their third-party CRM platforms
        so that these organizations use their own data to make business related decisions.

    How and why are APIs used by software developers? Assume you are building a
        website that sells different products and you want to include Amazon’s products in your
        website. One way to get the list of all of Amazon’s products is by contacting Amazon and
        requesting for a spreadsheet of all their products. But this means that you must find a way
        to import that spreadsheet into your application. Even if you find a way to import the
        spreadsheet data, that data will become outdated very quickly, for instance, the price
        might change, or the item might no longer be available. It will be better if Amazon
        provides you with a way to query their application/website to get the data (with its
        update) you want to use in your websites. Below, you will see why APIs are chosen way
        of sharing data from one application to another:
            ▪ Integration: API integration is a process of connecting two or more applications
                through their APIs. Meaning, API integration is the way by which a developer
                can include data from another application/website in their website. For instance,
                connecting your www.apple.com application/website with YouTube application
                to show Apple’s videos in your website.
            ▪ Efficiency: Rather than developers spending excessive time coding their own
                interface, companies can take advantage of the easy integration provided by
                APIs. This allows development teams to focus their efforts on other priorities.
            o Security: APIs supplement an extra layer of protection between your data and
                server, for example by integrating a two-factor authentication or by creating a
                password to log in. However, developers can add more security to APIs by using
                transport layer security (TLS) encryption (that keeps the internet connection
                private and checks if the data sent between two applications is encrypted). In
                short, with a little bit of knowledge, companies can easily protect their APIs from
                attacks.
