Introduction to API: what do we mean by API?
    ▪ API (Application Program Interface): In general terms, API is a software/framework
        that allows your application (for example, your www.apple.com website) to communicate
        and exchange data with other applications (for example, with YouTube).
    o Interface: Interface is the Keyword which in pure English means a point where
        two systems meet and interact. An API is a point where an application interacts
        with another application. In short, API is an interface with a set of
        functions/methods/code that developers use to access data from another
        application and integrate it into their application.
    ▪ API explained in simple example: Assume you are taken back to the year 1650 when
        telephone was not invented. Let us say you were in your house and your mom was in her
        house few blocks away from yours. Assume you wanted to ask your mom for her “doro
        wot” recipe, but you were too lazy to run down the road yourself. So, you sent your
        daughter with a message request for your mom. Your daughter ran down there and
        brought back the recipe back to you. In this example, your daughter is the API, she sends
        your recipe request to your mom and brings you back the response recipe from your mom
        while you and your mom stayed where you were.

    History of APIs: APIs have been around almost as long as computing. For instance,
        before the Internet, APIs existed, but in local networks form (covering limited area).
    o Modern APIs: However, the history of modern APIs (web-based APIs), began
        taking shape in early 2000s when Salesforce launched its web API followed by
        Amazon and eBay. These companies took advantage of the new medium, the
        internet, to make products and services available to customers via a single
        website and ensure that partners and third-party resellers could extend the reach
        of their websites. As internet (websites) continued to be the default medium of
        doing business, business companies that collect data from their customers started
        to be overwhelmed by their data to the extent that they became unable to
        read/share customer's data or even tell who their customer was or what they want.
        Because of that, companies started to hire third-party companies called Customer
        Relationship Management (CRM) platforms that store their data in the cloud.
    o Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platforms: In addition to storing
        a company’s data in the cloud, the CRM platforms use software to analyze a
        company’s data to improve the company’s customer service, to assist in customer
        retention and to ultimately to drive the company’s sales growth. Examples of
        renowned CRM companies/software are Salesforces, Zoho CRM and Bitrix24
